# In "Flappy Trigon," players control a small triangle character.
# The objective is to navigate the bird through a series of green pipes that have openings in them.
# The bird constantly moves to the right, and players must click the space bar to make the triangle flap and ascend.
# Releasing the space bar allows the bird to descend due to gravity.
# The goal is to fly the triangle safely through the gaps in the pipes without colliding with them.

# (Q) and (R) keys are also used to restart and quit the game
